## Build

This project is built with [xmake](https://xmake.io), but it also provides cmake and makefile files generated by xmake, which is convenient for some users who don't have xmake installed.

This project was developed using gcc 14.2.0 and clang 18.1.8. In theory, the compiler should support C++ 20.

- git clone or download this project source code.
- cd or cd after unzip
- `xmake build`
- `xmake test`

## Deps

- [endian: C++ library for conversion between big and little endian data representations.](https://github.com/steinwurf/endian)
- [optional: C++11/14/17 std::optional with functional-style extensions and reference support](https://github.com/TartanLlama/optional)
- [expected: C++11/14/17 std::expected with functional-style extensions](https://github.com/TartanLlama/expected)
- [spdlog: Fast C++ logging library.](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)

## About

### Page

The size of each page in toocal is the same as the operating system's virtual memory page size, but it also supports custom page size.

Page 0 and page 1 of toocal store the meta and freelist pages, which are used internally, so the real data will be stored starting from page 2.

### Serialization

toocal will serialize the internal data into files at a specific time, and all the data is in little endian order.

### Storage

toocal uses a balanced binary tree for storage, which will help reduce the number of disk accesses.

Each node in the tree is a key-value pair, and they are stored on disk using slotted pages technology, which is a layout for organizing key value pairs of different sizes by positioning fixed sized offsets at the beginning and the actual data itself at the end.
